# MlsetupBuilder
Cyberpunk 2077 modding tool to build json version of .mlsetup files (electron version)

A Compiled version is under the Release section on the right side

## If you want to compile it, clone the repository, then
```
cd MlsetupBuilder

npm install .

npx electron .
```
You are good to go. Happy Modding!

##Displaying the models

To display the models present in the model library you need a folder with the meshes from the game in .glb format and the masks layers in .dds format. More or less the size of the folder at the end of the process would be over 20 GB. You can uncook the main archives yourself or find WCLI-Kommander in the Cyberpunk 2077 Modding Community in discord (https://discord.gg/EgGjBr2Kfj) you'll find the batch file that uses Wolvenkit.CLI under the channel #resources
